 1. clone the repo.
 2. cd web-server, npm install, npm start.
 3. cd client, npm install, npm start.
 4. run project on http://localhost:3000
 
## if i had more time...

 1. validate the form.
 2. create more efficient ui (mostly in design aspect)
 3. set up db to save results
 4. write tests
 5. handle very large amount of url scraping
 6. handle errors more deeply (what if website from the list i scraped was broken?)
 7. create package json to run both client and server.
